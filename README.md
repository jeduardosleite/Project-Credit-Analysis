# Project EBAC - Python for Analysis in Data Science

## Objective

### To explore, manipulate, clean and visualize data using all the methods covered in classes. Additionally, create insight into the exercise.

## Problematic

### Why does the customer default? This is the central question of this exercise. To do this, we will analyze data from a fictitious financial institution, more precisely the response variable that is in the second column called default, where we will have: 0 = payer, 1 = defaulter

### I passed for this steps:
1) IDENTIFYING MISSING DATA
2) ITS TIME TO CLEAN DATA
3) REMOTION OF MISSING DATA
4) DATA VIEW
5) CONCLUSION
